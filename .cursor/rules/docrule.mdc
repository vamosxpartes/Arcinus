# Rules for Documentation Updates

When updating or adding features to the application, follow these rules to keep documentation up to date:

1. **Mandatory updates**: Every time you modify or add a feature in `lib/features`, you must update the corresponding documentation file in `lib/docs/features`.

2. **Update structure**:
   - If you modify an existing feature, update the corresponding `.md` file in the `lib/docs/features` folder
   - If you create a new feature, create a new `.md` file following the same structure as existing ones

3. **Documentation format**:
   - Maintain the existing section structure (Name, Purpose, Structure, Components, etc.)
   - Update the "Change Log" section with your modifications
   - Update diagrams or technical explanations if the architecture changes

4. **Review process**:
   - PRs without updated documentation will not be accepted
   - Reviewers will verify that documentation correctly reflects the changes made

5. **General documentation**:
   - If changes affect the general vision of the application, also update `lib/docs/documentation.md`

Remember: A well-documented application facilitates onboarding new developers and improves maintenance quality.
